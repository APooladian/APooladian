### Howdy

I'm at PhD student at the Center for Data Science at New York University, where my first year mentors are Jonathan Niles-Weed and Julia Kempe. Before joining the CDS, I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in (applied) mathematics at McGill University, the latter unde the supervision of Tim Hoheisel and Adam Oberman.

#### Current code in this repo
In this repo, there is code available for a few papers/pre-prints that I've worked on. Most noteably:
- the repo for the  "LogBarrier" adversarial attack (published at ICCV 2019), 
- the extension to non-smooth dissimilarity metrics (e.g. $\ell_0$, $\ell_1$, $\ell_\infty$, Total Variation), called "ProxLogBarrier" (published at AISTATS 2020), 
- a small repo for using the Ordered-Weighted L1 norm as an attack dissimilarity metric via the ProxLogBarrier framework
- the repo for "FarkasLayers" (pre-print), which uses basic notions of the well-known Farkas lemma to explain how batch normalization works
- a small repo for understanding batch-wise projections under the total variation seminorm

#### Code to come (hopefully)
- Code for "Normalizing flows using Entropy-Kantorovich potentials" (accepted to INNF+ workshop, with contributing talk)
- Code for my MSc thesis on the Fermat-Weber problem in polyhedral norms

#### Research interests
My interests lie at the intersection of optimization theory (convex, non-smooth, etc), computational and statistical optimal transport, high dimensional statistics, and problems in deep learning.
