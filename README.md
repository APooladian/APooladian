### About me

I'm a fifth year PhD student at the Center for Data Science at New York University, advised by Jonathan Niles-Weed. My research interests lie at the intersection of optimal transport, high-dimensional statistics, and optimization theory. This Github page contains the code for some of my research projects during my PhD (among other projects):

### Code is available for the following projects:
- “Algorithms for mean-field variational inference via polyhedral optimization in the Wasserstein space” with Roger Jiang and Sinho Chewi,
- "Debiaser Beware: Pitfalls of Centering Regularized Transport Maps" with Marco Cuturi and Jonathan Niles-Weed (ICML 2022),
- "Entropic estimation of optimal transport maps" with Jonathan Niles-Weed (2021) is also found in the above repo.
- An implementation of the 1-Nearest-Neighbor estimator for optimal transport maps, as seen in "Plugin Estimators for Smooth Transport Maps" (Manole et al., 2021)
