### About me

I recently started as a Foundations of Data Science (FDS) Postdoctoral Fellow at Yale University. Prior to this, I had the (immense!) pleasure of completing my PhD at New York University under the supervision of Jonathan Niles-Weed.

I am somewhere between an applied mathematician, statistician, and computer scientist—the term might be data scientist. During my PhD, I worked on tractable, principled methodologies for large-scale probabilistic inference based on the theory of optimal transport.

This Github page contains the code for some of my research projects:

### Code is available for the following projects:
- "Plug-in estimation of Schrödinger bridges, with Jonathan Niles-Weed (SIMODS 2025)
- “Algorithms for mean-field variational inference via polyhedral optimization in the Wasserstein space” with Roger Jiang and Sinho Chewi (FoCM 2024),
- "Debiaser Beware: Pitfalls of Centering Regularized Transport Maps" with Marco Cuturi and Jonathan Niles-Weed (ICML 2022),
- "Entropic estimation of optimal transport maps" with Jonathan Niles-Weed (2021) is also found in the above repo.
- An implementation of the 1-Nearest-Neighbor estimator for optimal transport maps, as seen in "Plugin Estimators for Smooth Transport Maps" (Manole et al., 2021)
