### About me

I'm a PhD candidate at the Center for Data Science at New York University, advised by Jonathan Niles-Weed. Before joining the CDS, I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in (applied) mathematics at McGill University, the latter under the supervision of Tim Hoheisel and Adam Oberman. My research interests lie at the intersection of optimal transport, high-dimensional statistics, and optimization theory. This Github page contains relevant code for (almost all of) my projects from my MSc onwards. 

### Code for my PhD projects
- the repo for "Debiaser Beware: Pitfalls of Centering Regularized Transport Maps" (ICML 2022, with Cuturi and Niles-Weed)
- the code for "Entropic estimation of optimal transport maps" (2021, with Niles-Weed) is also found in the previous repo

### Code for random things I wanted to implement
- an implementation of the 1-Nearest-Neighbor estimator for optimal transport maps, as seen in "Plugin Estimators for Smooth Transport Maps" (Manole et al., 2021)
- an implementation of a (batchwise) projection onto the total variation norm ball, as seen in "Total Variation Projection with First Order Schemes" (Fadili and Peyr√©, IEEE TIP 2010)

### Code for my MSc projects (no longer maintaining these)
- the repo for the  "LogBarrier" adversarial attack (ICCV 2019, with Finley and Oberman), 
- the extension to non-smooth dissimilarity metrics (e.g. &#8467;<sub>1</sub>, &#8467;<sub>2</sub>, &#8467;<sub>0</sub>, &#8467;<sub>&infin;</sub>, and Total Variation), called "ProxLogBarrier" (AISTATS 2020, with Finley, Hoheisel, and Oberman), 
- a small repo for using the Ordered-Weighted L1 norm as an attack dissimilarity metric via the ProxLogBarrier framework
- the repo for "FarkasLayers" (pre-print), which uses basic notions of the well-known Farkas lemma to explain how batch normalization works
