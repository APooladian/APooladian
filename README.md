### Howdy

I'm at PhD student at the Center for Data Science at New York University, where my first year mentors are Jonathan Niles-Weed and Julia Kempe. Before joining the CDS, I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in (applied) mathematics at McGill University, the latter unde the supervision of Tim Hoheisel and Adam Oberman.

#### Code in this repo
In this repo, there is code available for a few papers/pre-prints that I've worked on. Most noteably:
- the repo for the  "LogBarrier" adversarial attack (published at ICCV 2019), 
- the extension to non-smooth dissimilarity metrics (e.g. \ell_0, \ell_1, \ell_\infty, Total Variation), called "ProxLogBarrier" (published at AISTATS 2020), 
- and the 


#### Research interests
My interests lie at the intersection of optimization theory (convex, non-smooth, etc), computational and statistical optimal transport, high dimensional statistics, and problems in deep learning.
